# Project Name: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

## ☝️Problem: Sleep quality is vital for overall health and well-being, yet many individuals struggle with sleep disorders. Identifying factors contributing to poor sleep and predicting sleep disorders can aid in early intervention and management.

## 💡Solution: Leveraging the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, which comprises 400 rows and 13 columns covering variables related to sleep and daily habits, this project aims to analyze the data, process it, and develop machine learning classification models to predict the likelihood of sleep disorders. By examining factors such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, and more, the models can provide insights into sleep health and aid in identifying individuals at risk of sleep disorders.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Analyze Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset to identify patterns and trends related to sleep and daily habits.
- Preprocess and clean the data to prepare it for machine learning model development.
- Develop machine learning classification models to predict the likelihood of sleep disorders based on input variables.
- Evaluate model performance and provide insights into factors contributing to sleep disorders.
- Provide recommendations for improving sleep health based on data analysis.

## 🗂️ Dataset
I will utilize the "Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv" database from kaggle, that has been made available for us. Here you will find an analysis of the dataset, detailing the data processing steps, and the application of machine learning classification models to accomplish our objectives.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis and model development)
